Code for data analysis and simulations accompanying this Master thesis *TODO insert link*

Clone repository and run notebooks in your own Jupyter instance or click binder button above to run on other people's computers (aka 'the cloud').

  * `Numerical simulations.ipynb`: section 3.5 of thesis. Simulations for 3-site chain.
  * `Two-level system.ipynb`: section 4.3 of thesis. Data analysis for two-level system.
  * `Three-site chain.ipynb`: section 4.4 of thesis. Data analysis for dynamic U(1).

Notice that the computationally more intensive simulations are best performed at home, because it takes unfathomably long on the public BinderHub infrastructure.  The 'Numerical simulations'-notebook does not depend on the rest of the repository and can be just downloaded as file.

The included data is generated from scripts in https://github.com/tychon/redpitaya-measurements with setups described in the thesis.
